# QuickSort_InsertionSort

Create two functions named quick_sort(a) and insertion_sort(a)
 1. Request the user to enter a positive integer, and call it n
 2. Generate n random integers between -7000 to 7000 and save them in array a
 3. Call quick_sort(a) function to sort the array
 4. Call insertion_sort(a) function to sort the array
 5. Determine the average-running time of each function for n = 10000, and 100 repetitions
 6. Calculate the growth of each function. (On a scratch paper!)
 7. Calculate how many instructions your machine can run in a second using step 5 and 6 (using the running time of insertion sort)
